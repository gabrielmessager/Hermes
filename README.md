# üê¥ Hermes, we're coming after you

## What are we doing?
The goal of this exercise is to get you familiar with building web pages using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
We'll go slow and step by step so you can get a good understanding of the syntax, the best practices and how to find good resources online.

## Where to start?
Checkout the exercises folder and start with exercise #1. I'll keep adding more as we go and they'll get a bit more challenging each time. Each exercise will focus on a specific portion of the Hermes site so you can get a better understanding of the structure of the page.
